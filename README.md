Framework to make props deal additional damage when colliding with stuff in specific ways!
Comes with as many appropriate vanilla props "sharpified" as i could find!

See all the examples in lua/prop_sharpness_sharpdata for how to make models sharp!
Create a new lua file that fits the format of the examples, in a new addon's lua/prop_sharpness_sharpdata, to add more models!
(make sure the filename is unique)
